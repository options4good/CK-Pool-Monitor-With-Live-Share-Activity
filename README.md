<h1>CK Pool Monitor With Live Share Activity</h1>

Monitors the activity of CK Pool by parsing and displaying advanced operational/status data. In this version you can see the difficulty level of each share that was submitted to the pool. It gets the share activity data from the level 6 log file. The pool has to be started with the "-l 6" log level indicator at the end of the start command.<br><br>
